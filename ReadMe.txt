Note: We have used a basic template from Colorlib (https://colorlib.com/wp/cat/restaurant/) to save some unnecessary design effort. However, a strong amount of front end design has been implemented by us too. (Adding of layers, designing website logo, designing specific buttons, functionality of sign up and log in forms, modificatoin across different pages to suit stylistic needs)
